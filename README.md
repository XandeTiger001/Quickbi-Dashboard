# Dashboard: Simulated Quantum Attacks ‚Äî Quick BI Hackathon

**Hackathon:** Global Quick BI Hackathon (Alibaba Cloud)
**Year:** 2025
**Tool:** Alibaba Cloud Quick BI
**Objective:** Simulate and visualize the impacts of quantum attacks on different device scenarios, with analysis of cost, frequency, and mitigation time.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer:** All data is simulated for educational purposes. Inspired by trends from NIST, IBM, and cybersecurity reports. Does not represent a real incident.

## üìä Project Description

This dashboard provides an **interactive view of simulated quantum attacks** and their impacts on systems and devices. Key insights include:

- Growth of quantum attacks over the years.
- The 5 most costly attacks estimated between 2022‚Äì2025. - Average time to mitigate quantum attacks compared to traditional attacks.

The dashboard was developed to demonstrate risk analysis concepts, simulate cyber incidents, and visualize data.
